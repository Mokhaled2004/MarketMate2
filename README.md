## <h2>Story Behind MarketMate</h2>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
  
The inspiration behind MarketMate emerged from the growing need for a more streamlined and efficient way for people to do their grocery shopping, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic when visiting stores in person was often challenging and risky. The goal was to create a platform that simplifies the shopping experience by allowing users to easily compare prices, select products, and purchase groceries from various supermarkets online.

<h3>Technical Challenges</h3>

One of the significant technical challenges was building a clean Flask web app architecture and connecting the web static with the storage file. We learned everything by doing it, which gave us the experience, but also a lot of sleepless nights.

<h3>Overcoming Struggles</h3>

During the development process, there were moments of struggle, particularly with doing updates and adding features to improve and give users a better experience. We also faced challenges in designing a user-friendly interface that caters to both tech-savvy users and those who are less familiar with technology.

<h3>Future Vision</h3>

In the next iteration of MarketMate, we envision adding more features such as a rewards system for frequent users, AI-powered product recommendations, and integration with more payment gateways to offer greater flexibility. We also plan to expand our service area to cover more cities and regions.
